st.markdown('<div class="paragraph">Using our AI-powered mobile app and smart ring, we track physiological markers like heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and daily behavior to detect early signs of distress. We then offer real-time supportâ€”from peer connections to personalized insightsâ€”helping users take action before a full episode emerges. Our technology doesnâ€™t just monitor; it empowers.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
